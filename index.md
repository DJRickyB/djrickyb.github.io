# April Play For Charity

### Overview
Hi!  This is Rick Boyd.  I learned of this game Drawful 2 from a co-worker who pointed out it was free, and very easy to play remotely with a group of friends.  My wife Lauren and I gave it a shot with 4 of our friends from the neighborhood using a Google Hangouts call and our phones and had an absolute blast, playing for 2 hours and only stopping because we were too tired to go on.
We were thinking of ways to raise money during the COVID-19 crisis and thought this would be potentially the most fun way!  Here's how it will work:
* Check the SignUpGenius link below to find a timeslot
* Donate to the given charity via the provided bit.ly link (provided for convenience, we're not doing referrals or anything).  A suggested minimum of $10.
* Expect a GCal invite from me for the sign up with instructions.  If multiple players will play from the same location, plan on joining the meeting from one central device, and playing on separate phones/tablets.

### FAQs
> Do I need to buy the game?

No.  No purchase is necessary, just the donation to the designated charity

> How old should participants be?

There's some _slightly_ mature subject matter in the prompts, not to mention adults will be playing the game and making up their own, but the most important things are strong reading comprehension and spelling, so it would be pretty limiting for young people or those whose English is not very strong.  I'd recommend ages 13+ (especially since the games will be late enough to accommodate those of us who need to put young kids down for bed)

> Can I sign up for more than one day?

Yep! I literally have no idea if anyone will sign up for this, but if we fill up the available slots I will create more dates and add more charities.

> Have you considered other games?

There are many games that work well for something like this (most of the Jackbox games, for instance).  I'd be happy to hear if you have a favorite you'd like to try this with.

> What do I need to be able to play?

Two devices. 
* One screen to join the Hangouts call and see the game (laptop would be good, camera optional but not required), one per household.
* A tablet/phone to draw/write answers on, one per person.

> What is the learning curve?

We played with all 6 of us having never played before and picked it up very quickly.  We'll get you up to speed, you just bring the devices.  See Resources to get a feel for how this will go
